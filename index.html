        <p>One of my hobbies is crafting things from beeswax. To craft with beeswax you are supposed warm it by keeping it in your hand or keeping in the warm sunshine. I got to know about crafting from beeswax when I saw my cousine brother playing with it. He told me how use it and he gave a little bit of it to me. Since then I'v been making stuff out of the beeswax. It is very nice to craft things because you get to become very creative with what you can make with beeswax.</p>
